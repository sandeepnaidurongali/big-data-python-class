This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to
    those found in Perl.  It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both
    the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and
    characters outside the US ASCII range.
    
    Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.
    Most ordinary characters, like "A", "a", or "0", are the simplest
    regular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can
    concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.
